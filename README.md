Ensverif is a Python library that contains functions to assess the quality of ensemble forecasts or simulations. Those functions are:

- crps
- crps\_hersbach_decomposition
- logscore
- rankhist
- reliability

Those functions were initially coded in Matlab during my MSc and PhD degree. They were further improved over time, by my students (especially Rachel Bazile) and myself. 

If you don't want to use pip, the library is also available on Github, in Matlab and Python, here https://github.com/TheDroplets
